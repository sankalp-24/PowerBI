🚗⚡ India’s EV Growth Vs Charging Infrastructure – My Capstone Project Insights ⚡🚗

As part of my Data Analytics capstone project, I wanted to go beyond just building a dashboard — I wanted to answer a real-world question:

How ready is India’s charging infrastructure for the upcoming EV revolution?

I worked with data from Kaggle, cleaned and transformed it, and built an interactive Power BI dashboard to uncover trends and challenges.

💡 While many dashboards exist on EV adoption, what I focused on differently was connecting the growth of EVs with the pace of charging infrastructure development, and highlighting the gap and its potential impact on India’s EV future.

What I found:

📊 India has seen phenomenal EV adoption growth over the past few years.

🔌 Public EV charging stations grew from 1,800 in early 2022 to 16,000+ by March 2024.

📉 But the gap is still significant — to meet the projected 40% EV adoption by 2030, India needs ~400,000 new chargers annually (source: industry reports).

🏛 CAFV (Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle) eligibility — indicates whether a vehicle qualifies for government incentives — plays a role in understanding policy reach and adoption rates.

Difficulties I faced:

⚙ Data cleaning challenges — handling inconsistent column names, missing CAFV values (~11% unknown), and varying formats.
🗺 Geospatial mapping issues — aligning EV location data with Power BI maps for accurate visuals.
📊 Finding the right focus — many dashboards already exist on EV growth, so I had to think critically about how to add a unique perspective.

Why this matters:

⚡ Without enough charging stations, EV adoption can slow due to range anxiety and limited accessibility.

⚡ The imbalance between EV numbers and charging points can affect user experience, resale value, and confidence in switching from ICE vehicles.

How we can bridge the gap:

✅ Target high-EV adoption cities first for rapid charger deployment.

✅ Build public-private partnerships to accelerate infrastructure rollout.

✅ Use data-driven location planning to ensure maximum coverage and minimal congestion.

This project reinforced one key truth: Data is powerful when it drives action.

The EV movement is not just about selling more cars — it’s about building an ecosystem that supports them.

India is making strong progress in expanding its EV charging network. With continued data-backed planning, we can ensure that infrastructure keeps pace with adoption — moving towards a future where every EV has a charging point within reach. ⚡🚗
